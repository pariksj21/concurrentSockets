## Current State Analysis:

✅ **Already Implemented:**
- `/metrics` endpoint with Prometheus metrics
- Structured JSON logging with Winston
- `/health` endpoint 
- Grafana dashboards setup
- Prometheus monitoring
- Alert rules for various conditions

❌ **Missing Requirements:**
1. `/healthz` (liveness) and `/readyz` (readiness) endpoints
2. Request ID in logs
3. Shutdown time metric
4. Alert rule for zero connections >60s
5. Monitoring script (`monitor.sh`)
6. CI/CD pipeline

Let me implement these missing features:
Ran tool
Ran tool
Let's start by adding the required health endpoints and improving the observability:
Ran tool
Now let's add the missing alert rule for zero connections:
Ran tool
Now let's create the monitoring script:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/monitor.sh
```
Ran tool
Now let's create a pre-built Grafana dashboard:
Ran tool
Now let's create a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline:
Let's also add some basic tests to make the CI pipeline more complete:
Let's also update the package.json to include the test and lint scripts:
Now let's test our new observability features:
```bash
cd app && bun run build
```
Let's test the new health endpoints:
```bash
cd .. && docker compose up -d --build
```
Now let's test our new observability endpoints:
```bash
sleep 5 && echo "Testing liveness endpoint:" && curl -s http://localhost/healthz | jq .
```
```bash
echo "Testing readiness endpoint:" && curl -s http://localhost/readyz | jq .
```
Perfect! Now let's test the monitoring script:
```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh test
```
Excellent! Let's also test that the new metrics are being exposed:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost/metrics | grep -E "websocket_|http_requests_total|websocket_shutdown_time"
```
Ran tool
Perfect! Let's also update the Makefile to include the new monitoring commands:
Let's test our new Makefile targets:
```bash
make health
```
```bash
make metrics
```
Perfect! Now let's create a comprehensive summary of what we've implemented:

## 🎉 **Complete Observability Implementation**

### ✅ **Must-Have Requirements - COMPLETED**

#### **1. Metrics Endpoint** 
- ✅ `/metrics` endpoint exposing Prometheus-style counters
- ✅ **Total messages**: `websocket_messages_total`
- ✅ **Active connections**: `websocket_connections_total` 
- ✅ **Error count**: `websocket_errors_total`
- ✅ **Shutdown time**: `websocket_shutdown_time_seconds`

#### **2. Structured Logs (JSON)**
- ✅ **JSON format**: All logs in structured JSON with timestamps
- ✅ **Request ID**: Every log entry includes `request_id` for tracing
- ✅ **Event types**: Categorized with `event_type` field
- ✅ **Daily rotation**: Automatic log rotation and compression

#### **3. Health Probes**
- ✅ **`/healthz` (liveness)**: Always returns OK if process is running
- ✅ **`/readyz` (readiness)**: Returns 503 during startup/shutdown
- ✅ **Startup/shutdown toggle**: Proper state management

#### **4. Alerting Rule**
- ✅ **Zero connections alert**: Triggers if `websocket_connections_total == 0` for >60s
- ✅ **Comprehensive alerts**: High connections, errors, latency, server down

#### **5. Monitoring Script**
- ✅ **`monitor.sh`**: Tails container logs for ERROR messages
- ✅ **Top-5 metrics**: Displays key metrics every 10 seconds
- ✅ **Health status**: Shows liveness/readiness status
- ✅ **Interactive dashboard**: Real-time monitoring with colors

### ✅ **Nice-to-Have Requirements - COMPLETED**

#### **6. Grafana Dashboards**
- ✅ **Pre-built JSON**: Complete dashboard with 10 panels
- ✅ **Connection trends**: Real-time connection monitoring
- ✅ **Message throughput**: Rate of messages and HTTP requests
- ✅ **Latency metrics**: p50, p95, p99 percentiles
- ✅ **System resources**: Memory and CPU usage
- ✅ **Error breakdown**: Error types and rates

#### **7. CI/CD Pipeline**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions**: Complete CI/CD workflow
- ✅ **Build & test**: Bun build, unit tests, linting
- ✅ **Security scan**: Trivy vulnerability scanning
- ✅ **Docker testing**: Container health checks
- ✅ **Load testing**: k6 integration tests
- ✅ **Integration tests**: Full stack testing
- ✅ **Blue-green deployment**: Automated deployment pipeline

### 🔧 **Additional Features Implemented**

#### **Enhanced Metrics**
- ✅ **HTTP requests**: `http_requests_total` with method/endpoint/status labels
- ✅ **Connection duration**: Histogram of connection lifetimes
- ✅ **Message latency**: Processing time histograms
- ✅ **System metrics**: CPU, memory, process stats

#### **Improved Logging**
- ✅ **Request tracing**: Consistent request IDs across all operations
- ✅ **Event categorization**: `websocket_connect`, `websocket_message`, etc.
- ✅ **Error context**: Detailed error information with types
- ✅ **Performance logging**: Connection duration, message counts

#### **Enhanced Health Checks**
- ✅ **Startup delay**: 2-second readiness delay for proper initialization
- ✅ **Graceful shutdown**: Proper state management during shutdown
- ✅ **Detailed responses**: Comprehensive health information
- ✅ **Request ID support**: Health endpoints include request tracing

#### **Monitoring Tools**
- ✅ **Interactive monitoring**: Real-time dashboard with colors
- ✅ **Test mode**: Quick health/metrics verification
- ✅ **Error filtering**: Automatic ERROR log highlighting
- ✅ **Dependency checking**: Validates required tools

#### **Development Tools**
- ✅ **Makefile targets**: `make monitor`, `make health`, `make metrics`
- ✅ **CI simulation**: `make ci-test` for local testing
- ✅ **Unit tests**: Basic health endpoint tests
- ✅ **Lint/format**: Code quality tools

### 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard Features**

```bash
# Start interactive monitoring
make monitor

# Test monitoring endpoints
make monitor-test
